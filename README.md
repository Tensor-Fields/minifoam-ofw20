# miniFoam-OFW20

The purpose of the training is introducing the users to *How to write their own applications* using **OpenFOAM programming language**.

To this end, we will write solvers for two PDEâ€™s whose solvers are not provided by standard OpenFOAM fork, namely, the *wave equation* and the *minimal surface* equation. 

We will write the code from an empty text file to show where everything is coming from. Through this *from-scratch* journey, users get to intimately understand and use the classes that give OpenFOAM it superiority over other software, i.e., `GeometricField`, `polyMesh`, `fvMesh`, and `fvMatrix`.
